A file sharing and link shortening service.

## Purpose
This project began as a personal tool for shortening links and sharing files. After a few friends expressed interest, I decided to make it publicly available. You're welcome to use it, but please refrain from spamming or misusing the unlimited upload and sharing features.

### Features
- **File Uploads**: Upload files up to 500MB each, with no limit on the number of files. (Around 20GB of storage on my server available)
- **Link Shortening**: Supports long URLs. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out to me on Discord (deutscher775), and I'll address them promptly.
